features ~

case_sensetive for all language, remove punctuation for all language, remove stop words for all except Catalan, stemming for English & Spanish. Window size 13.

Hypernyms & hyponyms for English. 

Added 2 hyper & hypornyms for each sense available for the targeted lexelt

features 4.c

runtime ~

English has by far the longest runtime partly because of the wordnet requirements.

Classifier ~

linearSVM with default setting

Evaluation ~

The best features thus far is to remove 'U' from the training data. It boosted the score from the baseline score of .530 to .601. for the english language.
This might be because by removing any ambigous instance from the data improve the accuracy and quality of the training data.

Another feature/changes that led to drastically improves in accuracy is to use the select linearSVM classifier over knn.

The combination of stemming, removing punctuation, and adding highest score sense words provide a markly improve accuracy also. This might because the quality of feature is improved dramatically when we remove all the useless punctuation characters, and better semantical meaning capturing through word stemming.
